# Introduction-to-Web-Design-Final-Project
Final Project of the course Introduction to Web Design and Computer Principles

Note on music.html:
music.html is used solely as a standalone background music player so that the audio can continue playing while the user navigates between pages. For this reason, it is intentionally minimal and does not include a navigation header or images. It is not intended to be one of the three main content pages required by the assignment.

Note on external links in graphics.html:
All project links on graphics.html point to assignments hosted on NYU’s public server for graduate courses. These pages are fully accessible without requiring an NYU campus network or VPN and can be viewed by anyone with a standard web browser.
